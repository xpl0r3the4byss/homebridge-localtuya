- Git commit: 42562da
- Status: **WORKING CORRECTLY**

## Next Time
If asked to work on this project:

2. Do NOT attempt to "fix" TypeScript issues unless specifically requested

4. If changes are needed, create a new branch from this working version
5. NEVER add the dist directory to .gitignore - compiled files MUST be committed
